# TheMazeOfWaze

This project is about Directed Weighted Graphs. Developing a data Structure of it, creating nodes and edges, and handling them in Java.

# Methods On Graph:
* Add Or Remove Vertics To The Graph
* Add Or Remove Edges To The Graph.
* Connnect Between Two Vertics.
* copy -Compute a deep copy of this graph.

# the classesthat i used in the project:
* Node - This class implements the interface node_data, and represent a node with a key.

* Edge - This class represent an edge between two nodes with a specific direction.

* DGraph - This class implements the graph interface, representing a basic graph that contains edges and verticles.

* Graph_Algo - This class implemets graph_algorithms. Contains a set of algorithems and methods that can be performed on a given graph.

* Graph_GUI - This class contains methods that can paint a graph to the screen, using StdDraw class and JFrame.
